Intro DB project, NTUA 2013

Tools Used:
php (object oriented style)
jQuery 
jQueryUI
Datatables
HTML5

I implemented an MVC architecture using bare PHP and I also tried to implement a basic object relational mapping. I don't guarantee that the latter works in every case. 
This was a group project, so I didn't implement the database.
